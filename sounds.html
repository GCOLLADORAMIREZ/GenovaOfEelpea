	<h1>The Sounds Of Life In Eelpea</h1>
	<p>In Eelpea the sounds vary depending on where you are. Most of the time you will hear natural sounds, like certain trees and animals.  When you are near waters you can hear them constantly. Sometimes you can hear a water fairy sing. By a village you would hear many different types of music, kids playing, or people walking around spreading a positive chant.</p>
